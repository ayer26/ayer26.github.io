    Dear baby girl,

    Happy Valentine's day, my love. 
    I am really happy that I will be 
    spending this year's valentine's 
    day with you just like last year.
    I feel like I've always tell you 
    how thankful and happy that we're
    together. For more than 2 years of 
    andian, I really am very  grateful
    for your existence.You have saved
    me from this chaotic world, and 
    from my deep and dark past. Your 
    unconditional love has made me the
    man I am today. I want to work harder.
    be a better a boyfriend and soon, be 
    the best husband. I love you so much 
    my love, baby, babe, honeybunch, lovey
    and many more nicknames that we call
    each other. I really am very happy that
    I got to spend this Valentine's day with
    you and I will be looking forward to it 
    until the next few decades. 
    
    See you soonest, my Juliana.
